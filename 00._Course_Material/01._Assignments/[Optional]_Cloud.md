# [Optional] Learn about more cloud services and set them up in the portal

This is optional and does not relate to the SI exam.
I highly recommend doing it for DLS and your future career.
You will get time off in SI for it so please do your best.

Create Azure CDN and put the following static content on it served in multiple regions:
- image(s) 
- index.html (that contains a link to the image(s))

Bonus: Look into VPN Gateways, API Gateways and Load Balancers in Azure. Extra bonus would be to set them up. 

## Azure Key Vault

Setup secrets in Azure Key Vault.

Get those secrets in Github Actions:

Bonus: Try to get those secrets in another Azure service, for instance Azure Functions. 


**Remember**: Delete everything after use. The default SQL instance will consume all of your credit in no time.
