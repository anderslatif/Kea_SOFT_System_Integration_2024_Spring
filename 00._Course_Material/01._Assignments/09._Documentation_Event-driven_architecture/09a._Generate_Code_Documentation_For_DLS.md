# 09a [DLS Group] Generate code documentation for your DLS project

**Type**: DLS Group
 
Note: Since this is a group activity that you can draw for the exam, it's fine if one person sets it up but everyone in the group should be able to explain how it works for the exam. 

You are not required to cover your entire codebase since I understand that some of you might have microservices etc. that would make it difficult to cover everything. 

### Example of code documentation tools

You are free to use others but this if just for reference.
